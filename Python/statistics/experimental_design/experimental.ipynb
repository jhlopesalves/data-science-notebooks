    "### The Goal of Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a formal experiment is to move from informal observations to robust, quantifiable conclusions about cause and effect. It provides an objective and controlled way to test a specific hypothesis. Instead of a vague statement like \"X probably affected Y,\" a well-designed experiment combined with statistical analysis allows for a precise conclusion, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The evidence indicates that X had a statistically significant effect on Y, with a 5% risk of a Type I error (a false positive).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This level of rigor is essential in fields ranging from medical research and product analytics to marketing and government policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Subjects**: The entities on which the experiment is performed (e.g., users, patients, employees, plots of land).\n",
    "  * **Treatment Group**: The group of subjects that receives the specific change or intervention being tested.\n",
    "  * **Control Group**: The group of subjects that does not receive the treatment. This group serves as a baseline for comparison, showing what would have happened without the intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Critical Role of Random Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The validity of an experiment's conclusion rests almost entirely on how subjects are assigned to the treatment and control groups. The goal is to create two groups that are as similar as possible in every respect *before* the treatment is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Flaw of Non-random Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "A common but incorrect approach is to assign subjects non-randomly, for example, by splitting a list of users in half. This method is highly susceptible to **selection bias**. If there is any underlying order in the data (e.g., users are sorted by their sign-up date or activity level), the two groups will be systematically different from the start. Any observed difference in the outcome could be due to this pre-existing difference, not the treatment, making the experiment's results invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generic dataset of 200 subjects, sorted by a baseline metric\n",
    "# This simulates a non-random ordering\n",
    "np.random.seed(42)\n",
    "subjects = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'id': np.arange(200),\n",
    "    'baseline_metric': np.sort(np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=10, size=200))\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-random assignment by slicing the DataFrame\n",
    "group1_nonrandom = subjects.iloc[0:100]\n",
    "group2_nonrandom = subjects.iloc[100:]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compare the baseline metric for the two groups\n",
    "print(\"Group 1 Mean:\", group1_nonrandom['baseline_metric'].mean())\n",
    "print(\"Group 2 Mean:\", group2_nonrandom['baseline_metric'].mean())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The means are significantly different *before* any treatment is applied. An experiment conducted on these groups would be fundamentally flawed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution: Random Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random assignment** is the cornerstone of experimental design. By randomly assigning each subject to either the treatment or control group, we ensure that, on average, any pre-existing characteristics (both known and unknown) are distributed equally between the two groups. This isolates the treatment as the only systematic difference, allowing us to confidently attribute any observed change in the outcome to the treatment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, this can be achieved using the `.sample()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Random assignment using .sample() \n",
    "# Randomly select 50% of subjects for Group 1\n",
    "group1_random = subjects.sample(frac=0.5, random_state=42)\n",
    "# The remaining subjects go into Group 2\n",
    "group2_random = subjects.drop(group1_random.index)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compare the baseline metric for the two randomly assigned groups\n",
    "print(\"Group 1 Mean:\", group1_random['baseline_metric'].mean())\n",
    "print(\"Group 2 Mean:\", group2_random['baseline_metric'].mean())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With random assignment, the baseline means of the two groups are now nearly identical. This creates a fair and unbiased starting point for the experiment, ensuring that any significant difference observed after the treatment can be attributed to the treatment itself."
