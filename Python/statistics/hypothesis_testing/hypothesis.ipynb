    "## The Framework of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a core concept in inferential statistics. It provides a structured way to make decisions when faced with uncertainty. A common application is **A/B testing**, where a \"control\" group is compared to a \"treatment\" group to determine if a change had a real effect. The fundamental question is always the same: \"Is the difference I observed in my sample a real effect, or is it just a result of random sampling variability?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with a **hypothesis** about a population parameter. For example, we might hypothesize that the mean annual compensation for a population of data scientists is $110,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take a sample from that population and calculate a **point estimate** (the sample mean). If our sample mean is very close to the hypothesized mean, we have no reason to doubt the hypothesis. However, if our sample mean is very far from the hypothesized value, we might conclude that our initial hypothesis was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Bootstrap Distribution to Estimate Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide what constitutes \"far,\" we need to understand how much our sample mean is expected to vary by chance alone. The **standard error** quantifies this variability. As we've seen, we can estimate the standard error by generating a **bootstrap distribution** from our sample. The standard deviation of this bootstrap distribution is our best estimate of the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generic \"sample\" DataFrame\n",
    "np.random.seed(42)\n",
    "sample = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'compensation': np.random.normal(loc=120000, scale=50000, size=500)\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a bootstrap distribution of the sample mean\n",
    "bootstrap_dist = []\n",
    "for i in range(5000):\n",
    "    bootstrap_sample = sample.sample(frac=1, replace=True, random_state=i)\n",
    "    bootstrap_dist.append(bootstrap_sample['compensation'].mean())\n",
    "\n",
    "# The standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution is the standard error\n",
    "standard_error = np.std(bootstrap_dist, ddof=1)\n",
    "print(f\"Estimated Standard Error: {standard_error:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Z-Score: Standardizing the Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The **z-score** is a standardized test statistic that reframes the difference between our sample statistic and the hypothesized parameter in units of standard errors. This allows us to assess how \"surprising\" our sample result is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\text{Sample Statistic} - \\text{Hypothesized Parameter Value}}{\\text{Standard Error}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-score of 2.5 means our observed sample statistic is 2.5 standard errors away from the hypothesized value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate the z-score \n",
    "\n",
    "# Our hypothesis about the population\n",
    "hypothesized_mean = 110000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Our observed statistic from the sample\n",
    "sample_mean = sample['compensation'].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the z-score\n",
    "z_score = (sample_mean - hypothesized_mean) / standard_error\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Sample Mean: {sample_mean:.2f}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Hypothesized Mean: {hypothesized_mean}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Z-score: {z_score:.4f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if our z-score is large or small, we compare it to the **standard normal distribution**, which is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. If our original hypothesis were true, we would expect our z-score to be a value that could plausibly come from this distribution (i.e., a value close to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common threshold for statistical significance is a z-score whose absolute value is greater than **1.96**. This value corresponds to the middle 95% of the standard normal distribution. A z-score outside this range is considered unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone if the hypothesis were true.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If `|z| > 1.96`, we typically **reject the hypothesis**. The evidence suggests the true population parameter is different from what was hypothesized.\n",
    "  * If `|z| ≤ 1.96`, we **fail to reject the hypothesis**. The observed difference is small enough that it could plausibly be due to random sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the calculated z-score is greater than 1.96, so we would reject the hypothesis that the true mean compensation is $110,000. Our sample provides strong evidence that the true mean is likely higher."

    "## The Logic of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for making statistical decisions. The process is analogous to a criminal trial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There are two competing claims: the **null hypothesis ($H\\_0$)** and the **alternative hypothesis ($H\\_A$)**.\n",
    "2.  We begin by assuming the null hypothesis is true, just as a defendant is presumed innocent.\n",
    "3.  We collect evidence (our sample data).\n",
    "4.  We determine if the evidence is strong enough (\"beyond a reasonable doubt\") to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Null Hypothesis ($H\\_0$)**: The hypothesis of no effect, no difference, or the status quo. It is the existing idea or baseline that we assume to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * *Example*: $H\\_0$: The proportion of data scientists who started programming as children is 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Alternative Hypothesis ($H\\_A$ or $H\\_1$)**: The new \"challenger\" idea that a researcher wants to find evidence for.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * *Example*: $H\\_A$: The proportion of data scientists who started programming as children is greater than 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The wording of the alternative hypothesis determines which \"tails\" of the sampling distribution we are interested in. This determines the type of test we are performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$) | Test Type      | Question Asked                                                                 |\n",

    "\n",
    "### The P-Value: Quantifying \"Surprise\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The **p-value** is the core of the hypothesis test. It is a single number that quantifies how surprising our sample result is, assuming the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition**: The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic *at least as extreme* as the one calculated from the sample, given that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, the p-value is the area in the tail(s) of the null distribution, starting from your observed test statistic.\n",

    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Small p-value (e.g., p \\< 0.05)**: The observed data is very unlikely to have occurred by random chance if the null hypothesis were true. This provides strong evidence *against* $H\\_0$ and leads us to **reject the null hypothesis**.\n",
    "  * **Large p-value (e.g., p ≥ 0.05)**: The observed data is plausible under the null hypothesis. We do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. We never \"accept\" the null hypothesis; we only conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to overturn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating P-Values from a Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a z-score, we can use the **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** of the standard normal distribution to find the p-value. The `scipy.stats.norm.cdf()` function calculates the area under the curve to the left of a given z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Right-tailed test**: The p-value is the area to the *right* of the z-score.\n",
    "      * `p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(z_score)`\n",
    "  * **Left-tailed test**: The p-value is the area to the *left* of the z-score.\n",
    "      * `p_value = norm.cdf(z_score)`\n",
    "  * **Two-tailed test**: The p-value is the area in both tails combined. We find the area in the more extreme tail and double it.\n",

    "## The t-distribution: A Family of Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "While a z-statistic follows the standard normal distribution, a **t-statistic** follows a **t-distribution**. Like the normal distribution, a t-distribution is bell-shaped and centered at zero. However, it has a key difference: **it has fatter tails**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a t-distribution has more probability in its tails, reflecting the increased uncertainty we have when we use a sample standard deviation (`s`) to estimate a population standard deviation ($\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is not a single distribution but a **family of distributions**. The exact shape of a particular t-distribution is defined by a single parameter: the **degrees of freedom (df)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For a small number of degrees of freedom, the tails are very fat.\n",
    "  * As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution's tails become thinner, and it converges towards the standard normal distribution. A t-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom is identical to the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, **degrees of freedom** represent the number of independent values in a calculation that are free to vary. For an independent two-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom are calculated based on the sample sizes of the two groups. The standard formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n\\_1$ and $n\\_2$ are the sample sizes of Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The logic is that we start with $n\\_1 + n\\_2$ total observations and lose one degree of freedom for each of the two sample means we must estimate from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the p-value from a t-statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the t-statistic and degrees of freedom, calculate the p-value using the t-distribution's Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The `scipy.stats` library provides `t.cdf()` (analogous to `norm.cdf()` for z-tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation depends on the alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Right-tailed test** ($H_A: \\mu_1 > \\mu_2$):  \n",
    "  p-value = area to the *right* of t-statistic  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  p_value = 1 - t.cdf(t_stat, df=degrees_of_freedom)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Left-tailed test** ($H_A: \\mu_1 < \\mu_2$):  \n",
    "  p-value = area to the *left* of t-statistic  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  p_value = t.cdf(t_stat, df=degrees_of_freedom)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two-tailed test** ($H_A: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$):  \n",
    "  p-value = combined area in both tails  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  p_value = 2 * (1 - t.cdf(abs(t_stat), df=degrees_of_freedom))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Problem: Comparing Multiple Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "While a t-test is the appropriate tool for comparing the means of two groups, it is not suitable for comparing three or more groups simultaneously. Performing multiple t-tests on all possible pairs of groups (e.g., A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. C) on the same data dramatically increases the probability of committing a **Type I error** (a false positive). Each test has an $\\\\alpha$ chance of being wrong, and these chances accumulate as you perform more tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct approach is a two-step process: first, use an omnibus test (ANOVA) to see if *any* difference exists, and second, if a difference is found, use adjusted pairwise tests to find out where it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA** is a statistical test that determines whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. It works by comparing the amount of variation **between** the different groups to the amount of variation **within** each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses for ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Null Hypothesis ($H\\_0$)**: The population means of all groups are equal.\n",
    "    $$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_k$$\n",
    "  * **Alternative Hypothesis ($H\\_A$)**: At least one group mean is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA test is an **omnibus test**. A significant result (a small p-value) tells you that there is a difference *somewhere* among the groups, but it does not tell you which specific groups are different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANOVA in Python with `pingouin`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pingouin` library provides a user-friendly interface for conducting statistical tests. The `pingouin.anova()` function is straightforward to use. You must first install the library: `pip install pingouin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pingouin\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generic, reproducible dataset with multiple groups\n",
    "np.random.seed(42)\n",
    "group_means = {'Group A': 50, 'Group B': 55, 'Group C': 50}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'group': np.random.choice(list(group_means.keys()), 200),\n",
    "    'value': 0.0 # Placeholder\n",
    "})\n",
    "df['value'] = df['group'].apply(lambda g: np.random.normal(loc=group_means[g], scale=5))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualize the group distributions\n",
    "sns.boxplot(x='group', y='value', data=df)\n",
    "plt.title('Value Distribution by Group')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform the ANOVA test\n",
    "# dv: dependent variable (numeric)\n",
    "# between: the grouping variable (categorical)\n",
    "anova_results = pingouin.anova(data=df, dv='value', between='group')\n",
    "print(anova_results)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the result, we look at the p-value (`p-unc`). If `p-unc < α` (our chosen significance level, e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that at least one group mean is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pinpointing the Difference: Pairwise Tests with P-Value Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ANOVA test is significant, we proceed to the second step: **pairwise t-tests** to compare each group against every other group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem of Multiple Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, running many t-tests inflates the Type I error rate. To counteract this, we must apply a **p-value adjustment**. These methods modify the raw p-values from each t-test to control the overall false positive rate for the entire family of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pairwise Tests with Bonferroni Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bonferroni correction** is one of the simplest and most common adjustment methods. It mitigates the issue of multiple comparisons by multiplying each individual p-value by the number of tests being performed. This makes it \"harder\" for any single test to be declared significant, thereby controlling the overall error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pingouin.pairwise_tests()` function can perform this entire process automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Perform pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction \n",
    "# padjust='bonf' applies the correction\n",
    "pairwise_results = pingouin.pairwise_tests(\n",
    "    data=df,\n",
    "    dv='value',\n",
    "    between='group',\n",
    "    padjust='bonf' # Specify the p-value adjustment method\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# We are interested in the 'p-corr' (corrected p-value) column\n",
    "print(pairwise_results[['A', 'B', 'p-unc', 'p-corr']])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "You examine the **`p-corr`** (corrected p-value) column. If a `p-corr` for a specific pair of groups (e.g., 'Group A' vs. 'Group B') is less than your significance level $\\\\alpha$, you can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of those two specific groups. `pingouin` offers several other adjustment methods via the `padjust` argument, such as `'holm'` or `'fdr_bh'`, which are often less conservative than the Bonferroni correction."
