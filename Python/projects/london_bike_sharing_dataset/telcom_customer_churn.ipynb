    "# Telco Customer Churn – Univariate Predictor Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "![Churn Analysis](data/churn.png)\n",
    "### Project Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "You have received anonymised customer–account records from a fictitious telecoms provider.  Your task is to discover **which single column, on its own, is the most powerful predictor of churn** (i.e. whether a customer left the company last month).  You will train one‑feature logistic‑regression models for every candidate variable, compare their predictive skill, and report the champion feature in a two‑column DataFrame called `best_feature_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Business context** – Reducing voluntary churn is a primary driver of profitability in subscription businesses.  Pinpointing the one factor that most strongly signals attrition helps the retention team focus interventions and craft targeted offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **File** | Telco-Customer-Churn.csv (≈ 7k rows, 21 columns) |\n",
    "| **Target column** | Churn – \"Yes\" / \"No\" |\n",
    "| **Identifier** | customerID (must be excluded from modelling) |\n",
    "| **Predictors** | Mixed types: <br>• Demographics (gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents)<br>• Services (InternetService, StreamingTV, …)<br>• Contract details (Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod)<br>• Usage (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) |\n",
    "| **Missing data** | TotalCharges contains 11 blank strings → treat as NaN |\n",
    "\n",
    "A full data‑dictionary is available on the Kaggle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Practise **feature‑type diagnostics** and appropriate encoding (boolean, numerical, nominal, ordinal).\n",
    "2. Implement a **loop‑driven modelling workflow** with `statsmodels.formula.api.logit`.\n",
    "3. Compute **out‑of‑sample performance** via stratified 5‑fold cross‑validation.\n",
    "4. Consolidate results into a tidy ranking table and extract the top scorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Action | Expected artefact |\n",
    "|------|--------|-------------------|\n",
    "| 1 | Load the CSV into a DataFrame named `telco`. | – |\n",
    "| 2 | Convert `TotalCharges` to numeric, coercing errors to `NaN`, then mean‑impute. | Cleaned `telco` DataFrame |\n",
    "| 3 | Map `Churn` to binary **0 = \"No\", 1 = \"Yes\"**. | `telco['Churn']` as `int` |\n",
    "| 4 | Drop the `customerID` column. | – |\n",
    "| 5 | Identify candidate predictors: every remaining column except `Churn`. | Python list `features` |\n",
    "| 6 | For **each** feature:<br>a. Wrap with `C()` if categorical.<br>b. Fit `logit` on the training fold, predict on the validation fold.<br>c. Record the **AUC** for that fold. | List of dicts `results` |\n",
    "| 7 | Compute the **mean AUC** over the 5 folds for each feature. | `all_results_df` (feature, auc) |\n",
    "| 8 | Sort descending, take the top row, rename columns to `best_feature`, `best_auc`, and reset the index. | **`best_feature_df`** |\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Tip*  Use `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)` to maintain the churn ratio across folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`best_feature_df`** – a one‑row DataFrame with columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `best_feature`  (string) – name of the champion predictor.\n",
    "   * `best_auc`      (float) – its mean AUC, rounded to three decimals.\n",
    "2. (Optional) `all_results_df` – full leaderboard of feature AUCs for inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regularised Logit** – repeat the exercise with `fit_regularized` and observe whether the leader changes.\n",
    "* **Alternative Metrics** – compare rankings by accuracy, F1, and Matthews CC.\n",
    "* **Explainability** – draw a violin/box plot of the champion feature split by churn status to visualise separation.\n"
