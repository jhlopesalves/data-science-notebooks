This repository is my ongoing record of studying, experimenting, and building in data science.  
It contains my notes, curated resources, exploratory analyses, and complete projects in Python, R, and related tools.

The goal is twofold:  
- Keep a transparent log of my learning process across statistics, programming, and machine learning  
- Share reproducible and well-documented code that others can learn from or adapt

## Scope

What began as a place to recreate DataCamp exercises has grown into a broader learning and portfolio space.  
Here you’ll find:

- **Notebooks** – Theory notes, worked examples, and full analyses  
- **Datasets** – Raw CSV, JSON, and database files for practice  
- **Projects** – End-to-end studies, from exploratory data analysis to model evaluation  
- **Exercises** – Coding challenges and statistical problem-solving  
- **Resources** – Curated reading lists, cheat sheets, and tool references

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open any notebook in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab  
3. Install dependencies listed in each notebook or in `requirements.txt`  
4. Explore, run, and adapt the examples to your own data

## Educational Use

This repository is for personal study and skill development.  
It is not intended for commercial use or redistribution.  
Some content is adapted from courses I have taken; all additional notes, examples, and projects are my own work.
